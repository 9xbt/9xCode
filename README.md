# 9xCode
9xCode is an interpreted programming language that allows you to make simple programs using the console.

## Setting up 9xCode
This section of the readme has been moved [here](https://github.com/9xbt/9xCode/wiki/Setting-up-9xCode).

## Note
9xCode is still in beta, so if you find any issues please report them in the issues tab.

## A lil update
9xCode will be now developed specifically for [GoOS](https://github.com/Owen2k6/GoOS) serving as a secondary language to code in.
